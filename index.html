    <p>I joined Moringa School on Monday 11th March.</p><p>From Moringa School I have learnt how to create websites.</p>

    <h2><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
    </div>
    <p>I completed my university education from The University of Nairobi in 2018</p><p>At the University, I studied a <span id="me">Bsc.Biochemistry</span></p>
    <p>During my long holidays in university, I did a couple of attachments.</p><p>I will list the attachments I did from year 1 to year 4 in order:</p>
  <div class="may">

    <ol>
      <li>I worked for NHIF as an enumerator.</li>
      <li>I worked in a pharmacy as an assisatant to the pharmacists.</li>
      <li>I worked in a clinic at the receiving desk and also did research on the different medical conditions presented.</li>
      <li>I did sales for a food manufacturing company.</li>
  </ol>
  </div>

    <p>I joined Moringa to study programming</p>
    <p>I over the years while in university had the desire to understand computers and a course called Bioinformatics in university stimulated this urge farther</p>
    <p>With this interest in mind, after university, I decided to research on programming schools in Kenya and my former university classmate recommended Moringa as an option</p>
    <p>I sort advice from other sources and that is how I landed in Moringa studying programming.</p>
